            This video contains the clips used for the finals of my university classes, CDM 198 as well as CTS 040B. These were used 
            to explain the interpolation within an animator's context. For the paper a total of 7 figures are shown, 6 of which are
            present in the above video compilation.

        <p>
            This piece is the only one of the bunch <a>NOT</a> made specifically for this project. Within the paper this is Fig. 2 out of the 7 
            shown. Initially Ex. 3 was going to be taking this slot but after Ex.3 was finished, I decided it was too subtle to be used as 
            an example within the paper. With my limited time leftover, I decided to include this piece as it was a fantastic example of
            shapes being moved and messed with using interpolation.
