        <h2>Learning Journal 5 - Game Design UX Best Practices</h2>
        <time>Monday, February 22, 2021</time>
        <div id="differ"></div>
        <p>
            Within the article, <a href="https://uxplanet.org/game-design-ux-best-practices-guide-4a3078c32099">Game Design
             UX Best Practices</a> by Amir Dori, he goes over a subject that is pretty self-explanatory from the title. Other
              than the stand-out examples such as Persona 5 by Atlus, game User Interface and Experience usually flies right
               over my head. Regardless, this article is far more on the mobile game market than the console game market.
        </p>
        <p>
            What I found most interesting was the explanations as to why companies format their interfaces how they do. What
             I was not expecting was those decisions being based on human-based habits and profits. I almost feel as if these
              practices feel almost predatory in how they function to get the audience to pay money. The best examples are from
               when Dori explains the design process for shop buttons and shop UIs. The fact that they are built to maximize
                clickability and sales is honestly fascinating, genius, but downright scummy in my opinion. Even if I think so, 
                understanding concepts such as this one is mandatory in order to build a game that will gain and retain popularity.
        </p>
        <p>
            The most important thing to take away from all of this is how to make things most visible, accessible, and understandable
             with the limited space provided. Understanding that the positions of objects will have to correspond with an
              option/selection that is of equal value to its size and positioning is extremely important in the long run. The easier
               an audience has navigating and experiencing your application, the better. There are also smaller, but equally
                important design elements Dori goes over, so please go over and read <a href="https://uxplanet.org/game-design-ux-best-practices-guide-4a3078c32099">the article</a> if you can!

        <h2>Learning Journal 4 - Every Picture Visual Analysis</h2>
        <time>Wednesday, February 10, 2021</time>
        <div id="differ"></div>
        <p>
            Of the images within my archive for this assignment, I would say the most interesting is the painting of myself at
             around the age of five. It was painted by my dad, Rick Ortega, back in 2005. To this day, this is by far the most detailed
              portrait made of me regardless of me doing my own self portraits at times. Because it has a strong connection to my
               family’s history in art as well as a direct connection between my dad and I, I would say it fits within the theme I
                have planned quite well.
        </p>
        <p>
            When it comes to my archive, the set of images tells my story of growing up with artistry all around me. I am proud
             of the people who helped me grow as an artist so I wish to highlight how my dad as well as the people he introduced me
              to. I will try to document my growth but I for sure want to show what I grew with.
        </p>
        <img src="images/JacobPainting.PNG" alt="My Young Portrait" style="width: 400px;" class="ljFour">

        <p>
            For the archive of images relayed to me by my group member, Sammi Rowen, I picked the group picture that
             I believe to be a family photo. From my understanding of a previous conversation Sammi and I had, this photo shows
              Sammi alongside siblings of hers with her father, who is the center of the picture.
        </p>
        <p>
            What I find most visually interesting about this image is the lens it puts you through. This image is a product of its
             time of being taken, a snippet of the 1990’s within a singular photograph. With the clothes, the image quality, as
              well as prior knowledge of the story behind it, it makes this aspect of the photograph far more interesting when viewing
               it.
        </p>
        <p>
            I personally would not say anything is mysterious about this image. It is a family photo, there is not much more to it
             than that. I would say there is an obvious showing of the difference in the looks and fashion of the time of the
              image being taken versus the time of it’s viewing. Time has passed, whether obvious or not, it makes the archive
               alongside this image far more memorable and interesting to view.
        </p>

        <h2>Learning Journal 3 - Images and Visual Thinking</h2>
        <time>Wednesday, February 3, 2021</time>
        <div id="differ"></div>
        <p>
            The article written by Micahel Gonchar named <a href="https://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/">10 intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and
                Visual Thinking Skills </a>, introduced concepts that have not been unfound within my school experience.
            But that is beyond the scope of this assignment. While browsing through Awwwards.com, I stumbled
            upon an article named <a href="https://2020-dm.com/">This was 2020 </a>, an article written by DeMorgen to discuss 2020
            through a creative visual lens. In this, the user is shown a kaleidoscope of aspects of the year
            2020. All of the refracted pictures move as you move your cursor but they are easy to pick out and
            try to figure out their meanings. It makes users try to piece together a story month-by-month of
            the aspects of 2020. If users don’t recognize something or don’t know the full stories, the website
            also provides access to a list under the kaleidoscope that shows each image as shown, alongside
            an article about the topic that can be accessed through this list. Overall, it is a creative
            approach to visual storytelling on a topic that people will want to learn. I would recommend giving
            this article a try if the chance were to arrive.

        <h2>Learning Journal 2 - Overuse of Overlays</h2>
        <time>Wednesday, January 27, 2021</time>
        <div id="differ"></div>
        <p>This week for the reading and response, I went on to learn about overlays with Kathryn Whitenton and their article <a id="links" href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/overuse-of-overlays/">Overuse of Overlays: How to Avoid Misusing Lightboxes</a>. In this article,
            I discovered another useful user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design ideology/perspective. I thought it was interesting how small changes between overlays, messages, and new
            pages work for better navigation of a page. Understanding the vision and general understanding of web pages that the consumer has is a super important thing to keep in mind when designing
            a website. Whether it is making sure page sizes are correct or the visibility of the background within the webpage is made clear that it is not interactable is an interesting aspect of web
            design that most consumers, such as myself, don’t put too much thought into. While I believe in the design ideologies Apple put into place as explained in this article, I will for sure keep
            these pieces of information in mind if I ever need to use messages and/or overlays of some sort for whatever reason.

        <h2>Learning Journal 1 - Best Practices for Form Design</h2>
        <time>Wednesday, January 21, 2021</time>
        <div id="differ"></div>
        <p> User Experience(UX) as well User Interfaces(UI) are parts of website design we as a populace tend to forget
            how much time and care goes into it. The article by Salim Ansari, <a id="links" href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best Practices for Form Design</a>, goes into
            depth about what should and should not be used when making such UI and UX design choices. When I was reading
            this article, all I could think about was the many times I have seen both the best and worst practices used
            in big-named company websites and apps. I think one that sticks out to me the most out of any is the inline
            labels and placeholder text. I have seen so many companies use the dimmed text to signify what to type in an
            input field, but never realized that it is not the best thing to do from a UI/UX perspective. Some of the
            “don’ts” never really bother me as the consumer, but this made me realize that everyone is different. Many
            people will or won’t go through the effort of going through complicated sites based on their preferences. I
            never really found a compiled place to have good advice for when planning my sites, so this article is a
            fantastic place to get inspiration for my future projects.</p>
