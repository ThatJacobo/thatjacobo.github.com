        <h2>Learning Journal 2 - Overuse of Overlays</h2>
        <time>Wednesday, January 27, 2021</time>
        <div id="differ"></div>
        <p>This week for the reading and response, I went on to learn about overlays with Kathryn Whitenton and their article <a id="links" href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/overuse-of-overlays/">Overuse of Overlays: How to Avoid Misusing Lightboxes</a>. In this article,
             I discovered another useful user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design ideology/perspective. I thought it was interesting how small changes between overlays, messages, and new
              pages work for better navigation of a page. Understanding the vision and general understanding of web pages that the consumer has is a super important thing to keep in mind when designing
              a website. Whether it is making sure page sizes are correct or the visibility of the background within the webpage is made clear that it is not interactable is an interesting aspect of web 
               design that most consumers, such as myself, don’t put too much thought into. While I believe in the design ideologies Apple put into place as explained in this article, I will for sure keep 
               these pieces of information in mind if I ever need to use messages and/or overlays of some sort for whatever reason.

        <h2>Learning Journal 1 - Best Practices for Form Design</h2>
        <time>Wednesday, January 21, 2021</time>
        <div id="differ"></div>
        <p> User Experience(UX) as well User Interfaces(UI) are parts of website design we as a populace tend to forget
            how much time and care goes into it. The article by Salim Ansari, <a id="links" href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best Practices for Form Design</a>, goes into
            depth about what should and should not be used when making such UI and UX design choices. When I was reading
            this article, all I could think about was the many times I have seen both the best and worst practices used
            in big-named company websites and apps. I think one that sticks out to me the most out of any is the inline
            labels and placeholder text. I have seen so many companies use the dimmed text to signify what to type in an
            input field, but never realized that it is not the best thing to do from a UI/UX perspective. Some of the
            “don’ts” never really bother me as the consumer, but this made me realize that everyone is different. Many
            people will or won’t go through the effort of going through complicated sites based on their preferences. I
            never really found a compiled place to have good advice for when planning my sites, so this article is a
            fantastic place to get inspiration for my future projects.</p>
