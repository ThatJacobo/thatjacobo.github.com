        <h2>Learning Journal 3 - Images and Visual Thinking</h2>
        <time>Wednesday, February 3, 2021</time>
        <div id="differ"></div>
        <p>
            The article written by Micahel Gonchar named <a href="https://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/">10 intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and 
            Visual Thinking Skills </a>, introduced concepts that have not been unfound within my school experience. 
            But that is beyond the scope of this assignment. While browsing through Awwwards.com, I stumbled 
            upon an article named <a href="https://2020-dm.com/">This was 2020 </a>, an article written by DeMorgen to discuss 2020 
            through a creative visual lens. In this, the user is shown a kaleidoscope of aspects of the year 
            2020. All of the refracted pictures move as you move your cursor but they are easy to pick out and 
            try to figure out their meanings. It makes users try to piece together a story month-by-month of 
            the aspects of 2020. If users don’t recognize something or don’t know the full stories, the website 
            also provides access to a list under the kaleidoscope that shows each image as shown, alongside 
            an article about the topic that can be accessed through this list. Overall, it is a creative 
            approach to visual storytelling on a topic that people will want to learn. I would recommend giving 
            this article a try if the chance were to arrive.

        <h2>Learning Journal 2 - Overuse of Overlays</h2>
        <time>Wednesday, January 27, 2021</time>
        <div id="differ"></div>
        <p>This week for the reading and response, I went on to learn about overlays with Kathryn Whitenton and their article <a id="links" href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/overuse-of-overlays/">Overuse of Overlays: How to Avoid Misusing Lightboxes</a>. In this article,
            I discovered another useful user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design ideology/perspective. I thought it was interesting how small changes between overlays, messages, and new
            pages work for better navigation of a page. Understanding the vision and general understanding of web pages that the consumer has is a super important thing to keep in mind when designing
            a website. Whether it is making sure page sizes are correct or the visibility of the background within the webpage is made clear that it is not interactable is an interesting aspect of web
            design that most consumers, such as myself, don’t put too much thought into. While I believe in the design ideologies Apple put into place as explained in this article, I will for sure keep
            these pieces of information in mind if I ever need to use messages and/or overlays of some sort for whatever reason.

        <h2>Learning Journal 1 - Best Practices for Form Design</h2>
        <time>Wednesday, January 21, 2021</time>
        <div id="differ"></div>
        <p> User Experience(UX) as well User Interfaces(UI) are parts of website design we as a populace tend to forget
            how much time and care goes into it. The article by Salim Ansari, <a id="links" href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best Practices for Form Design</a>, goes into
            depth about what should and should not be used when making such UI and UX design choices. When I was reading
            this article, all I could think about was the many times I have seen both the best and worst practices used
            in big-named company websites and apps. I think one that sticks out to me the most out of any is the inline
            labels and placeholder text. I have seen so many companies use the dimmed text to signify what to type in an
            input field, but never realized that it is not the best thing to do from a UI/UX perspective. Some of the
            “don’ts” never really bother me as the consumer, but this made me realize that everyone is different. Many
            people will or won’t go through the effort of going through complicated sites based on their preferences. I
            never really found a compiled place to have good advice for when planning my sites, so this article is a
            fantastic place to get inspiration for my future projects.</p>
