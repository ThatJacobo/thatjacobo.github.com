            <p class="top">Rick Ortega, my father, has always been an amazing, Chicano artist. He grew up being able to do art that is nothing short of inspiring for me and apparently many others.</p>
            <p class="top">Rick has been featured in many galleries throughout his life. Whether it was small, local galleries, or big galleries in completely seperate cities, he has been able to show and create for many throughout his years. I myself have sat in at shows of his all throughout California. The one I always will remember most is ChimMaya, a gallery that my dad was featured at for majority of my life thus far.</p>
            <p class="top">All throughout my life, my dad would sit in his studio within the Garage and paint for hours at a time. As a kid I would always sit inside and get a glipse of what being a fine artist really was. As a child, it really inspired me to try to make and develop my own artistic abilities, and I am thankful for that.</p>

            <h1 class="top" id="JayColor">Jacob Ortega: The Sequel</h1> <!-- wow I really had to make an ID just for color -->
            <p class="top">I grew up in a household that did not fear artists. Thanks to my pops, both were luckily the type of people that embrace artistry and the field I want to work in. I am free to draw, write, create as I see fit. If I have the willpower and determination to do it, I have permission to.</p>
            <p class="top">I did learn a lot of my artistic skillset from my dad overall. This is all thanks to the art that was a constant in my life thanks to hanging around my dad's studio, being taken to art shows/galleries, or even just having art resources available at any time. Were it not for this, who knows if I would be sitting where I sit right now. I am here because of this development.</p>        
            <p class="top">So, to conclude this end of the website, thank everyone who helped me get this far. Thank you to my mom, thank you to my dad, but also thank those who are reading this for just spending their time to look at my silly little projects.</p>        <!-- <button id="stop">Stop the script</button> -->

            <p class="top">My mom has been one of the most supportive people in my life. While my dad helped drive me to become an artist, my mother nurtured me so I could go and make that dream a reality. My ma helped me live, which is one of the most important things if we are all being honest. She is an inspiration in more ways than one and I am glad she is here within my life.</p>
            <p class="top">Growing up, she would often hype me up whenever I would partake in creative tasks, which would encourage me to continue forward reguardless of what others said. It was her encouragement that pushed me to drive for a higher education in the matter so I could pursue a career in this work field. While I give all the thanks to my dad for my creative feats, my ma is just as important in my lifestyle feats.</p>

            <div class="picinfo"><p class="words4">Vincent Ortega, Painted by Rick Ortega</p></div>
            <img src="images/VincentOrtega.jpg" alt="Vincent" id="cover4">

            <h1 class="top" id="Vgk">Vincent Ortega: The Elder</h1> <!-- wow I really had to make an ID just for color -->
            <p class="top">My oldest brother Vincent has never really been a creative type. He himself gave me a better understanding of how other people react to arts when they are not in tune with their creative side. He by no means hates art, I am not trying to allude to that, but understanding how people react to artist when they are not artists themselves is something important to learn. Getting to know these types of people is extremely important when you plan or working with some in the future.</p>
            <p class="top">Reguardless, my eldest brother has helped me exponentially. Because he is a little less than a decade older than me, he would often spoil me, his little brother, with gifts that have made me exponentially happy. A lot of the objects he has treated me to were art supplies, things I could use in my day-to-day and would help further my skills by using them in the long run. </p>
            <p class="top">Thanks Vinvent, dunno if I'll ever show this to you, but I appreciate what you have done for me throughout the years!</p>

            <h1 class="top" id="MattColor">Matthew Ortega: The Center</h1> <!-- wow I really had to make an ID just for color -->
            <p class="top">MAN, screw this guy. Nah I am just kidding, Matthew is basically my twin so we mess around with each other a lot. Even though we are two years apart in age, we look, sound, and act extremely similar. He is my closest familial compatriate so he has pushed me further than most would think.</p>
            <p class="top">Sure, Matthew and I have had our scuffles, sure we have been constantly compared growing up, but that only pushed both of us to improve ourselves to try and be compared less. He is not exactly an artist, he doesn't have the patience for it. While this is the case, it is no doubt that he pushed me as an artist even if it was on accident. The fact taht we were compared PUSHED me to further my skills in areas he was not interested in.</p>
            <p class="top">So to conclude, thank you Matthew. We may not be able to see eye-to-eye, but I am grateful you have been there.</p>
