            <p class="top">Rick Ortega, my father, has always been an amazing, Chicano artist. He grew up being able to do art that is nothing short of inspiring for me and apparently many others.</p>
            <p class="top">Rick has been featured in many galleries throughout his life. Whether it was small, local galleries, or big galleries in completely seperate cities, he has been able to show and create for many throughout his years. I myself have sat in at shows of his all throughout California. The one I always will remember most is ChimMaya, a gallery that my dad was featured at for majority of my life thus far.</p>
            <p class="top">All throughout my life, my dad would sit in his studio within the Garage and paint for hours at a time. As a kid I would always sit inside and get a glipse of what being a fine artist really was. As a child, it really inspired me to try to make and develop my own artistic abilities, and I am thankful for that.</p>

            <h1 class="top" id="JayColor">Jacob Ortega: The Sequel</h1> <!-- wow I really had to make an ID just for color -->
            <p class="top">I grew up in a household that did not fear artists. Thanks to my pops, both were luckily the type of people that embrace artistry and the field I want to work in. I am free to draw, write, create as I see fit. If I have the willpower and determination to do it, I have permission to.</p>
            <p class="top">I did learn a lot of my artistic skillset from my dad overall. This is all thanks to the art that was a constant in my life thanks to hanging around my dad's studio, being taken to art shows/galleries, or even just having art resources available at any time. Were it not for this, who knows if I would be sitting where I sit right now. I am here because of this development.</p>        
            <p class="top">So, to conclude this end of the website, thank everyone who helped me get this far. Thank you to my mom, thank you to my dad, but also thank those who are reading this for just spending their time to look at my silly little projects.</p>        <!-- <button id="stop">Stop the script</button> -->
