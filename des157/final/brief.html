            To further improve my ‘Every Image” project further, I wish to
             further develop the amount of options and interactions within my website.
              This would include more articles, scrolling gallery of images, and more information
               associated.
        </p>
        <h2 id="netflix">>Comparison 1 - Netflix:</h2>
        <p>
            While the streaming platform has more images in a 
            compact space than I am hoping for, the aspect of a scrolling, 
            horizontal series of images is what I hope to conceive in my project. 
            It has an easy to understand, interactable user interface that knows how 
            to lead it’s customers to where they need to go using good visual 
            hierarchy and excellent visual queues. I love more minimal/clean design 
            elements, so how they display anything that is their own is extremely impressive 
            to me. I find the overall experience of scrolling through what is comparable to my 
            ideas as very satisfying. You can tell this was made by an excellent set of 
            designers and coders.

        <h2 id="jodie">>Comparison 2 - JodieGG’s Portfolio:</h2>
        <p>
            The portfolio of my friend and fellow student, Jodie Gayagoy, proves 
            as a good example of the type of content and interaction I strive to 
            introduce into my website. Having images that can be clicked on for further 
            information is the key to what I wish to do. This creates nice interactivity 
            for the user that only leads to further knowledge of the content the audience 
            is there for to begin with. Even using basic fading animations such as the 
            banner she introduced into her design is beautiful and something I wish to 
            take inspiration from when creating my piece. It has a beautiful yet simple 
            monochromatic color scheme that I myself enjoy quite a lot on websites as you 
            can tell from the one you are looking at now. The only part of this I don’t 
            exactly enjoy is the fading text during scroll, as the images around it do not 
            fade as well. I am guessing this is not possible to change because of the means 
            of making it, but it annoys me nonetheless.

        <h2 id="goals">>Goals</h2>
        <p>
            Overall, I want to create a website that will show off articles through 
            thumbnail-like interactivity that can be scrolled through in a horizontal 
            axis. Websites/applications such as the ones above are great examples of how 
            I want to get this done. The Xbox interface has a clean rotating slideshow that 
            has many clickable and automatic elements I wish to apply. Jodie’s website has 
            a color scheme I wish to take inspiration from as well as articles that are 
            easy to read and have a lot of specific, but readable info. While I want to make 
            my UI have very little scrolling elements, the two websites are good inspiration 
            otherwise.
        </p>

        <h2 id="design">>Design Strategies</h2>
        <p>
            I plan to keep my website looking similar in theme to the current studio 2. 
            This would include spotlights with a black and white aesthetic with the exception 
            of one color, as well as the hover, clicking, and scrolling design mechanics that 
            were in place before. The only difference I can see is applying a new font, as my 
            previous choice was purely because futura is what I default to when I have no time 
            to try out the aesthetics of many fonts. I may also change the size of the overall 
            User Interface, as things were either too big or too small in some cases mattering 
            on your screen size. Getting the overall piece to look balanced no matter the screen 
            may pose a challenge. Also, creating backgrounds for the articles may create a 
            better unity with the home page as well as a better user experience to understand it 
            is a popout. Overall there are many tweaks I can put in place to better my website’s 
            experience.
        </p>

        <h2 id="interaction">>Interaction Strategies</h2>
        <p>
            As mentioned before, I wish to make the original, two-picture home page into 
            a multiple-clickable-image, slideshow-esque, horizontal scrolling gallery. This 
            may take some work to make look good, but getting easy-to-understand moving images 
            similar in vein to a streaming site but on a larger scale is my goal. Alongside 
            that, I hope to add some features I wasn’t able to in my website’s original creation 
            such as the clickable images in the article’s slideshow that would display the 
            image on a larger/proper scale, or the scrolling, image-changing slideshow. As I 
            work I might add some surprise features, but these are what I strive to achieve.
        </p>

        <h2 id="experience">>Experience Goals</h2>
        <p>
            When a user enters my site, I want them to be greeted with a simple layout 
            including images in a row with names attached alongside the title “Galleria de 
            Ortega” or Gallery of Ortega. I will have some pointing arrows on the edges of the 
            shown images that will alert the user of more images that can be found by pressing 
            the arrow. In doing so, the user should hopefully mouse over an image which would light 
            up with a spotlight. In doing so, I hope that the user would figure out to click the 
            image because of this interactivity and open an article. The article will have an image 
            with a description on the right and an article that can be read on the left. The article 
            will be slightly big enough to alert the audience that it can be scrolled down on. If the 
            audience scrolls, it will display a separate image that coincides with the article. 
            Regardless of their placement on the page, there will always be an ‘X’ to always show 
            the audience the exit of the page.
        </p>
