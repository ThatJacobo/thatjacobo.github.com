        <h2>>The Scrollbar needs updating</h2>
        <p>More than once did I hear about complaints with the scrollbar that is shown within my 
            home page. Often, it seems it was either because it stuck out like a sore thumb 
            or it was because it was clunky to use. I actually understood this immediately, as 
            it was a complaint I myself had during developement. Still to this moment I still wish 
            to remake the scrollbar to include the arrows I drafted up back in my initial mockups.
            It might take some time, but scrolling with something that isn't that eyesore would be ideal.
            I think the arrows will end up being the neutral colors to fit the content as needed, it 
            would not be ideal to get rid of an eyesore for another eyesore.

        <h2>>Spotlight Issues</h2>
        <p>There were come complaints about the spotlight in this testing that I did not even 
            recieve during the initial viewing of this site, which is super interesting. None of 
            the complaints were unjustified though, I sort of agreed most times. The one that I heard 
            at least twice had to do with the placement. More than one person definitely did not like 
            the fact that the spotlight stopped in its tracks as soon as it hit the scroll bar, which 
            I agree with! But because of the way I coded it, it might be hard to get the moving scroll with that 
            though. It is definitely something I will look into. The one complaint I don't exactly agree 
            with is that the spotlight function is unappealing and takes away from the images. As this 
            is supposed to immitate a gallery I personally think it adds to the experience I meant to happen.
             So sorry to that reviewer, but that is how I feel.

        <h2>>Screen Size Issues</h2>
        <p>This one was completely unexpected for me actually. Never during my inital testing did I ever 
            run into as many bugs as I did within these user tests. While the user had no idea that 
            some of the features were bugging out, I was writing notes on what went wrong and plan to 
            fix a few of them. The one major thing that I saw break was due to screen sizing. I did not 
            account for more than 2 seperate screen sizes during my initial testing as I thought it would 
            be fine, but my testers had screens so big that it literally broke my articles. The spotlight 
            would be too high, images in the articles would be too small etc. I only got a screenshot of the 
            spotlight, but the images looked far worse. They were too small, the info bar was completely 
            disconnected, and you could see some aspects of the site that I did not want seen when the article 
            was opened.
        </p>
        <p>
            I might fix the spotlight alongside the other complaints from the previous section, but the images 
            might just be a lost cause without writing in multiple screen sizes within my code. I understand that 
            multiple sizes is actually good practice, but as it is unnecessary in this project AND I have very 
            little time, I may or may not get around to fixing for screens that I actually do not have access to.
            We'll see later on.
        </p>

        <p>
            Currently I cannot say how much I will be able to fix within the two-day timeframe. While 
            this is the case, I do hope to fix at least the scrollbar issues by implementing a div that 
            will activate a script that will scroll the page left to right. At least, this is my 
            hypothesis on how it will work, only time and testing will actually teach me how to properly 
            implement the interface function. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The basic styling updates might get done, they are not high on my priority but it does feel 
            nice to have a cohesive and readable design. I think the first order of business in this 
            category is the title. Multiple people commented on its size and font choice, but it did not 
            seem significant enought to mention in the points above. This will be fixed with simple font 
            research and testing. Nothing too in depth will have to be done for this.
        </p>
        <p>
            No matter how it is currently, I am actually quite proud of the assignment as it stands. 
            It isn't perfect by any means, but it means a lot to me.
        </p>
